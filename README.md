# GODOT-Platformer-Game
It is a game that i made in godot. In this game there are three levels and you have to climb to the top to clear each level.
I am only uploading the screenshots and the link to the whole project here as it is way to big and would be very tedious to upload every single thing from the project here.
Also the multiplayer is still a work on progress so it does not work.
If you want to try the game out go to the link below and download the folder called "main game .exe file" and to see the code download the whole folder in drive and open it with GODOT.
